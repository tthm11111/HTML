        <h2 id="where">Where Does CSS Come From?</h2>
        The idea of style sheets is as old as standardized general markup languages. Cascading
        Style Sheets, usually referred to as CSS, were initially proposed in 1994. This was
        during the times of the browser wars and CSS was the least consistently rendered
        language for the browsers. Opera was an early almost perfect adopter, but the W3
        Consortium were trying to create a standard with buy in from the more popular browsers
        Internet Explorer and Netscape. As CSS became standardized web browsers began to improve
        their support and today most modern browsers support CSS in a fairly consistent manner.
        The HTML5 standard has eliminated much of its design formatting features and offloaded
        that work to the CSS standard. HTML5 expects you to use CSS to make your pages look good.
        This is because HTML was always great at describing documents, but often terrible at
        making them look really great. And making webpages look great is where CSS shines.<br>
        
        CSS easily lets you build stylesheets for whole websites so you can make changes to
        your corporate identity in one place instead of having to touch every file in your website.
        If you decide to move all your website backgrounds to blue from brown, no problem! Just
        modify and publish that master style sheet CSS file and you are done.
        
        <h2 id="how">How a Style Sheet Works</h2>

        <img src="waterfall.jpg" alt="This is a picture in which a waterfall surrounded by green trees">

        The word cascade is used to describe how CSS works and here should remind you of a 
        waterfall. The water falls down and hits the various ledges until it looks a certain 
        way. Waterfalls are beautiful, so it is a fitting metaphor for making the web a beautiful
        place.  
        
        This idea of a waterfall effect is what Håkon Wium Lie, the inventor of CSS and chief 
        technical officer for Opera, intended for us to think about when he proposed CSS in 1994. 
        In CSS we can have many different style rules ranging from general to very specific, 
        and often it is the last, most specific rule that will take precedence over how the 
        browser will display the web page content. Think of it like this: we wash the styles 
        over the document until it looks just the way we want it too. While Håkon Lie called 
        this process of styling the webpage the cascade, others have called it the war of 
        the styles. 

        <h2 id="order">The Order of the Cascade</h2>
        
        Understanding the rules of the cascade are important. Often when students have 
        unexpected results from CSS it is because they do not understand how CSS decides what 
        style rule wins in a given situation. 
        
        <blockquote> <p> When two elements have the same specificity value then the declaration that comes 
        last in the source code wins.</p></blockquote>

        There are three levels of priority in the evaluation of the CSS cascade: <i>Origin and
        Importance</i>, <i>Specificity of the Selector</i>, <i>Order of Appearance</i>, and 
        <i>Inheritance</i>. Each of these priority levels has different rules as to how they 
        are evaluated, but when we have a rule that clearly wins at a level then it is applied 
        to the webpage, otherwise the next level is evaluated. This is why sometimes you add 
        a style rule and it seems to make no change to your webpage, something with a greater 
        priority has applied its rule first. 

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Original and Importance</strong> 

            <p>Origin has to do with where the style rule originates. This allows the browers and 
            even the end user to make design decisions based on their needs, which is helpful
            for greater accessibility in web browsing. You can include an important operator (!) 
            to a style rule to override the origin priority. Note that all browsers have default
            style rules which have the lowest priority at this level unless they are given an
            important operator (!) which will give them the highest priority.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Specificity of the Selectoe</strong>

            <p>Selector specificity has to do with how specific our selector is. A selector on a
            generic HTML tag has the lowest priority here. The order of preference for selector 
            specificity is:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Inline style rules that are part of the HTML tag (style= attribute). These
                    are the most specific because they only apply to the element to which they
                    are attached. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Identifier (id=) selectors which use the # symbol in CSS. Because these are
                    meant to be unique identifiers they are the next most specific way to select 
                    an element.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Class, pseudo-class, and attribute identifiers are the next
                    level of specificity. A class can reference many elements so it is less
                    specific than an id= attribute. I can also reference states of an element like
                    hover (:hover) or find an element that has an attribute with a specific value 
                    like type="checkbox".</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The least specific selector is the generic HTML tag name and pseudo-elements 
                    based on these tag names like div::first-line which targets just the first line
                    of a div element. </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Oder of Appearance</strong>

            <p>The order in which you include your CSS style sheets is really important. The rule is 
            that the last declaration, closest to the element selected, wins the war of styles. This 
            is why inline CSS is discouraged, as it is always going to override other style declarations
            and if you need to make a change inline declarations are the hardest to locate. Also if you 
            are to employ a CSS reset, to clear out unwanted CSS declarations, always include that link 
            before your custom CSS link or you will simply reset all the work you have done.</p> </li>

            <li><strong>Inheritance</strong>

            <p>Inheritance in CSS has to do with the fact that elements are often nested within other 
            elements. We call the elements inside children of the parent elements. A child can often 
            inherit style rules from its parent, although this is of lowest priority so CSS allows 
            you to force this by setting a style rule to the value inherit. </p></li>

        </ul>
        <h2 id="the">The Anatomy of a Selector </h2>
        <p>In CSS the selector is how we apply a style rule to a specific part of our webpage. 
        Selectors dictate the specificity of our style rule. Selectors can be multiple, separated 
        by commas as a list before the opening squiggly bracket ({) that indicates the start of a 
        CSS rule block. If you separate a selector with a space it indicates that the second 
        selector is a child of the first selector. For example, p em { font-weight: bold; }, would 
        apply bold to the font of any em (emphasis) elements inside a p (paragraph) element, and 
        this rule would not be applied to em (emphasis) elements that are not immediate children 
        of p (paragraph) elements. Finally, selectors also have logical operators that allow us to
        target elements of our webpage with incredible specificity.</p>
